# LEARNLOG

Here's a log of everything I'm learning as I'm building this basic todo app with the latest Rails stack.

### Pico CSS

What a nifty little CSS framework! Having CSS based entirely on basic, semantic HTML is super helpful
when you just want to build out some basic UI. It's very easy for me to get lost in the weeds of
styling, so this helps keep me focused on the backend for the most part.

### Rails Authentication Generator

What a blessing to set up some basic email based authentication with a single command! I love that.

### Custom Form Builders

I wanted to customize the default form helpers Rails provides to automatically append field errors as
helper text in the markup that Pico CSS specifies, and I eventually found my way to custom form
builders to de-dupe that behavior. It's a solid way to pull that pattern into its own class.
